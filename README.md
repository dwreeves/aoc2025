# AOC 2025

https://adventofcode.com/2025/

I've been coding for over 10 years, but all in high-level languages.
I am interested in learning a lower-level language.
I'm not quite sure which one to pick.
I figured Rust was a good choice as it is quite popular in the Python ecosystem, so I can probably find some use for it.
I've also dabbled in Rust previously.

So far, I have solved **3/12** of the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles in Rust.

Stipulations:

- No vibe-coding, no cheating on solutions algorithmically.
- Rust docs and StackOverflow are allowed. Ignore Gemini Google search results.
- Claude can assist with compiler errors only.
- Use minimal 3rd party libs. So far, only Clap and Clippy.
- No copy + pasting across modules. (Get muscle memory down for typing Rust!) Peeking is fine.

The code here is almost certainly sloppy.
I'm interested in keeping this as a time capsule where I can one day look back and see my progress.
